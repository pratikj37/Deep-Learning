# Deep-Learning
  Deep Learning is an Artificial Intelligence [AI] function that imitates the workings of the human brain in processing data and creating patterns for use in decision making.
  
## Deep Learning Models
1. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

#### 1. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) 
A single neuron can be imagined as a Logistic Regression. Artificial Neural Network, or ANN, is a group of multiple neurons at each layer.
ANN consists of 3 layers - Input, Hidden and Output. The Input layer accepts the inputs, the hidden layer processes the inputs, and the output layer produces the result. Essentially, each layer tries to learn certain weights.
These can be applied to solve problems related to Tabular data, Image data and Text data.

#### 2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
The building blocks of CNNs are filters (kernels). Kernels are used to extract the relevant features from the input using the convolution operation. They are prevalent in image and video processing projects.
CNN learns the filters automatically without mentioning it explicitly. These filters help in extracting the right and relevant features from the input data.
